[MidiPipe](http://www.subtlesoft.square7.net/MidiPipe.html) and
[SimpleSynth](http://notahat.com/simplesynth/) are two great programs. I use
them for testing.

For MIDI input, I create a MidiPipe that has a keyboard going to a Midi Out
directed at MidiPipe's output. I set up SimpleSynth to listen on its virtual
input. This file describes a simple setup that uses these two programs.
