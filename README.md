# SeaMaster

SeaMaster is a C version of [PatchMaster](https://patchmaster.org/).

More docs to come.

# To Do

Support backslashes in .sm file to escape commas. Or maybe a parser, or
perhaps titles on a separate line.

"use midi" flag in PM, replace "testing".

Should PatchMsater be returned by load()? What does that do to reload?

Display controller filters and maps.

Load should be more robust. Count args (e.g. input and output creation) and
make sure not null.
