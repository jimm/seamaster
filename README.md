# To Do

Names for connections.

Simple play display mode: show song title, patches, and notes.

Load should be more robust. Count args (e.g. input and output creation) and
make sure not null.

Info window should bold "\*text\*" and italicize "\_text\_".

It wouldn't be difficult to have the loader support Markdown as well as Org
mode. Besides heading character changes, comments couldn't start with '#'.
