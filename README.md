# SeaMaster

SeaMaster is a MIDI processing and patching system. It allows a musician to
reconfigure a MIDI setup instantaneously and modify the MIDI data in real
time.

With SeaMaster a performer can route MIDI between keyboards, split
controlling keyboards, layer MIDI channels, transpose them, send program
changes and System Exclusive messages, limit controller and velocity values,
modify controllers, and much more. At the stomp of a foot switch (or any
other MIDI event), an entire MIDI system can be totally reconfigured.

SeaMaster is a C+ version of [PatchMaster](https://patchmaster.org/).
