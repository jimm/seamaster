# To Do

Simple play display mode: show song title, patches, and notes.

Remove casts wherever Lists are used.

"use midi" flag in PM, replace "testing".

Display controller filters and maps.

Load should be more robust. Count args (e.g. input and output creation) and
make sure not null.

It wouldn't be difficult to have the loader support Markdown as well as Org
mode. Besides heading character changes, comments couldn't start with '#'.
