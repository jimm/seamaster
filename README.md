# To Do

Fix ListWindow bounding/scrolling problem.

Remove casts wherever Lists are used.

Convert to .org mode for files.

"use midi" flag in PM, replace "testing".

Display controller filters and maps.

Load should be more robust. Count args (e.g. input and output creation) and
make sure not null.
