# Instruments

Short names for inputs and outputs don't have to be same or different. This
text is ignored.

| I/O | port            | short | name          |
| --- | --------------- | ----- | --------------|
| in  | input port one  | one   | first input   |
| in  | input port two  | two   | second input  |
|:---:| --------------- | ----- | --------------|
| out | output port one | one   | first output  |
| out | output port two | two   | second output |

# Messages

Bytes can be hex or decimal and can span multiple lines. One message (one-
to three-byte MIDI message) per line. Sysex is not yet supported. Commas are
ignored. Sorry, no symbolic names yet.

## Tune Request

```
0xf6
```

## Multiple Note-Offs

0x80, 64, 0
0x81, 64, 0
0x82, 42, 127

## Testing Another Literal Syntax

Nothing really different to test here, but Org mode has something to test.

Indentation doesn't matter. Again, this text is ignored. Song notes appear
after the song heading and before the first patch heading.
