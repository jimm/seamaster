* Instruments

Short names for inputs and outputs don't have to be same or different. This
text is ignored.

| in  | input port one  | one   | first input   |

|-----+-----------------+-------+---------------|
| out | output port one | one   | first output  |
| out | output port two | two   | second output |

* Messages

Bytes can be hex or decimal and can span multiple lines. One message (one-
to three-byte MIDI message) per line. Sysex is not yet supported. Commas are
ignored. Sorry, no symbolic names yet.

Indentation doesn't matter. Again, this text is ignored. Song notes appear
after the song heading and before the first patch heading.

** Song Without Explicit Patch

* Ignore This Section

Any top-level section that isn't one of
- Instruments
- Messages
- Triggers
- Songs
- Set Lists
should be ignored. Let's see:

** This is Not a Song

*** This is Not a Patch
**** bad, 2, badder, 99

* Set Lists

Two other bullet list characters are accepted: "\*" and "+". Org mode
requires that lists using "\*" are indented, else they will be seen as
top-level headlines.

** Song List One

  * To Each His Own
  * Another Song

** Song List Two

+ Another Song
+ To Each His Own
