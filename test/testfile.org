* Instruments

Short names for inputs and outputs don't have to be same or different. This
text is ignored.

| I/O | port            | name  |
|-----+-----------------+-------|
| in  | input port one  | inst1 |
| in  | input port two  | inst2 |
|-----+-----------------+-------|
| out | output port one | inst1 |
| out | output port two | inst2 |

* Messages

Bytes can be hex or decimal and can span multiple lines. One message (one-
to three-byte MIDI message) per line. Sysex is not yet supported. Commas are
ignored. Sorry, no symbolic names yet.

** Tune Request

* Songs

Indentation doesn't matter. Again, this text is ignored. Song notes appear
after the song heading and before the first patch heading.

** Song Without Explicit Patch

* Ignore This Section

Any top-level section that isn't one of
- Instruments
- Messages
- Triggers
- Songs
- Set Lists
should be ignored. Let's see:

** This is Not a Song

*** This is Not a Patch
**** bad, 2, badder, 99

* Set Lists

Two other bullet list characters are accepted: "\*" and "+". Org mode
requires that lists using "\*" are indented, else they will be seen as
top-level headlines.

** Set List One

  * To Each His Own
  * Another Song

** Set List Two

+ Another Song
+ To Each His Own
